    <h1>hot chocolate</h1>
    <p><em><strong>
        Place the milk of your choice in a saucepan over medium-low heat. <br>Using milk instead of water, makes this hot chocolate extra creamy and flavorful. I prefer whole milk or 2% milk, but you can choose any milk that you choose (Iâ€™ve even used unsweetened almond milk).
Whisk in cocoa powder and sugar, and heat until warm.<br>
Once the milk is warm, add chocolate chips, whisking until they melt into the milk.<br>
Add a splash of vanilla extract.<br>
Serve immediately, topped with your favorite garnishes: marshmallows, whipped cream, chopped chocolate, crushed candy canes or more.<br>
